# Roll-A-Ball
Easy tutorial to get familiar with the basics of Unity

## What is this going to teach you?
You're going to learn the basics of Unity from creating **GameObjects** to applying physics through the **Rigidbody** component and applying force to an object through keyboard input.  No assets will be imported for this project, nor will there be models, sounds, textures, or animations.  This will be bare bones so you can focus on functionality over style!

**Let's begin!**

## The Steps
1. Create a new project, if needed, you can do this by opening file **new project** then naming it and saving the project location.  

2. Next, you should have a new project open so let's save it.  You can do this by opening file again, **save scene**, and save it in the assets file.  You can name it what you like.

3. Okay, after it's saved, let's create a floor for our ball.  Go into **GameObject**, then **3DObject**, and click **Plane**.  This will give you a floor pane in your Hierarchy that you can adjust, or move around.  After setting it, clear the gear icon on the top right and click **reset** this sets the GameObject to 0,0,0
